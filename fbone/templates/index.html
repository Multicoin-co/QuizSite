    <p>What is The Fun Revision App?</p>
    {#  Include Or Reasons for making the application Here #}
    <p>The Fun Revision App is a simple application which lets students revise. There are many websites and application which gives this service of revision for students but what makes us The Fun Revsion App unique is the way the revision content is presented. Our app will present the revision content in such a way that the students will enjoy revising from. Using relatively interesting pictures and fun facts we have made our app unique so the student can enjoy revising. When revising without pictures and facts the students tend to get bored more quickly with revising so thought it would be helpful if we could make the process of revision more fun and easy.</p>
